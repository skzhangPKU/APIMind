## GUIMind
---
GUIMind is a novel automated tool to detect violations of the Data Minimization Principle. The tool consists of two modules: Explorer and Fidelity Checker. Explorer utilizes a reinforcement learning model to explore app activities and monitor access to sensitive APIs that require sensitive permissions. Fidelity Checker uses the existing tool [APICOG](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9251054) to check whether an activity collects more sensitive permissions than the users expect.

## Getting Started
---
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
---
* A rooted Google Pixel 5 device
* Frida version corresponding to your device if not a Google Pixel 5 device
* Python >= 3.7.3
* Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

## Installation
---
1. Clone the GUIMind GitHub repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AnonymousSE202X/GUIMind.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the pre-trained weight models, Frida, and Standford NLP Parser from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FrDyUGGBHNazm8rrT5ZFW3nj_iLYQNDA?usp=sharing) and place them in the corresponding directories in the project. **Please note that if you are using an emulator or another rooted device, instead of a Google Pixel 5 device, it is necessary to download the appropriate version of Frida**. Otherwise, the project will not launch successfully.

## Usage
1. Connect your rooted Google Pixel 5 mobile device to your local machine and enable USB debugging.
2. Run the Explorer module to monitor and record app activity and sensitive API access.
   ```sh
   cd Explorer
   python explorer.py
   ```
3. Use the recorded data as input for the Fidelity Checker module to evaluate whether app activity violates the Data Minimization Principle. **Please note that Fidelity Checker has slight variations in each run.** The log of Fidelity Checkerâ€™s results in our paper is shown in `gb2.log`. 
   ```sh
   cd FidelityChecker
   python fidelity_checker.py
   ```
4. Analyze the output report generated by the Fidelity Checker module to identify violations of the Data Minimization Principle.

#### Example:
Explorer will output the contents like the Figure below when it runs successfully.
